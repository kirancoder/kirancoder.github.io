## Research Interests

- Trajectory Optimization (Direct & Indirect Methods)
- Optimal Control and Reinforcement Learning
- Spacecraft GNC and Re-entry Dynamics
- Machine Learning for Aerospace Systems

## Current Focus
I am particularly interested in **physics-informed learning** and **optimization-based guidance**
for space missions, including planetary landing and debris collision avoidance.

title: "About Me"
---

I am an aerospace engineer with strong interests in
trajectory optimization, optimal control theory,
and guidance, navigation, and control (GNC).

I completed my **M.Tech in Aerospace Engineering**
with a focus on optimization-based trajectory design
and machine learning-assisted control methods.

My long-term goal is to pursue **doctoral research**
in optimal control and space systems engineering.
